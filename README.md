# Movie-recommender-systems-

This project is one Iâ€™ve made during my Msc at Skema. 

The goal was to build a recommender system from a dataframe made up of user ratings for a wide selection of films.
First part is dedicated to clean and prepare the data. Second and third parts are dedicated to the realization of the recommender system.
